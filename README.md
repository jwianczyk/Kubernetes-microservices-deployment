# Deploy microservices application in Kubernetes with production and security best practices

The goal of this project is deployment of microservices application in Kubernetes cluster using best practices for
security and production.
- `Kubernetes`
- `Redis`
- `Linode`
- `Linux`

Project description:
- Create `K8s manifests` for `deployments and services`
- Deploy microservices to `Linode's managed Kubernetes cluster`
----

This project is based on sample microservices repository of Google at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.

The only code I take credit for is `config.yaml` which is made for deployment of microservices.
