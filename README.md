The goal of this project is deployment of microservice using helmfile
- `Kubernetes`
- `Helm`
- `Helmfile`

Project description:
- Deploy microservices with `Helm`
- Deploy microservices with `Helmfile`


---------

This project is based on sample microservices repository of Google at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.

The only code I take credit for are `config.yaml`, `values` directory, `helmcharts` and `helmfile` which are made for deployment of microservices with helm.
