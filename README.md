# Create Helm chart for microservices

The goal of this project is creating a Helm chart for microservices created in the previous project.
- `Kubernetes`
- `Helm`

Project description:
- Create one shared `Helm chart` for all microservices to reuse common deployment and service configurations for the
services
-------

This project is based on sample microservices repository of Google at https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo.

The only code I take credit for is `config.yaml` which is made for deployment of microservices.
